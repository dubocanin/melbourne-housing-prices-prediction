Dear User,

I hope the data provied here will help you in your work to some extent.
For everyone familiar with machine learning (ML) and exploratory data analysis, any further 
instructions are probably not necessary. However, for all those that are just stepping itno the ML field,
here are some, hopefully useful instructions on how to use the code and data provided.

1) All datasets are stored in the "Data" folder...untouched data set and a cleaned one (it is a good to have both of them for the comparison)
2) All plots generated for the purpose of the project are stored in the "Plots" folder
3) Within each R script provided, functions and the purpose of each line of code is explained (hopefully in detail, if something is missing however, please let me know.)
4) Make sure to properly change the data path and navigate to the folder which you will use as your project folder.
5) Make sure to install all necessary libraries (in the code I have loaded more than what necessary just because many of them are useful for later use)
6) I personally use R-Studio for coding with R, since I find it quite neat and user friendly especially for beginners.
7) Have a good time and let me know if you are facing some problems.

Cheers! d(^.^)b
